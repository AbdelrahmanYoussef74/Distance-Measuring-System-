# Distance-Measuring-System-

* Hardware and Components: 
- ATmega32 Microcontroller with a frequency of 8 MHz.
- Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04.
- 4x16 LCD.
- Appropriate cables and connectors for wiring.
- Power supply for the components.
- Drivers
* GPIO Driver:
  Implement a GPIO driver for controlling general-purpose input/output pins without referencing any specific course material.

* ICU Driver:
- Create an Input Capture Unit (ICU) driver for capturing time intervals without referring to any particular course materials. Configure the ICU to work with a frequency of F_CPU/8 and to detect the rising edge as the first edge. The ICU_init and ICU_setCallBack functions should be used for setting up the ICU.

* LCD Driver:
- Implement an LCD driver to control the 4x16 LCD display without referring to any specific course material. Use an 8-bit data mode. Connect the control pins and data pins as follows:

RS → PB0
RW → Ground
E → PB1
Data Bus → all PORTA pins.
Ultrasonic Driver: Develop a complete Ultrasonic Driver using the ICU driver. This driver should contain the following functions:

void Ultrasonic_init(void): Initialize the ICU driver, set up the ICU callback function, and configure the trigger pin as an output.
void Ultrasonic_Trigger(void): Send a trigger pulse to the ultrasonic sensor.
uint16_t Ultrasonic_readDistance(void): Send a trigger pulse, start the measurements with the ICU, and return the measured distance in centimeters.
void Ultrasonic_edgeProcessing(void): This callback function is called by the ICU driver to calculate the high time (pulse time) generated by the ultrasonic sensor.
